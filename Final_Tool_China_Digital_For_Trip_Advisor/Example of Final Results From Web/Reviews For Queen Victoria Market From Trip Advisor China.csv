Go early (start at 5 pm) and you will be able to see everything before it gets very busy. The stall here sells food from all the countries I can think of.

The market is somewhat different from usual, it is smaller and the air is better. The main atmosphere is selling and selling. What impressed me the most in the market was the numerous food stalls. From pancakes and honey dumplings to Spanish dishes and kebabs. The only problem with eating is that there is no place to sit. The seats are full before the official opening, so go early. There are activities for the whole family, ranging from paintings for children to live bands for older children. Thank Idontgetoutmuch",Neutral,Positive

I went to the unheard gas lamp market for the first time last night. It was an eye-opener. Awesome! A variety of meals are served for dinner and will never make you go home hungry!! I ate something they call European flavor at a food stall-it tastes good , And only 63 yuan, great value. My companion ate it at a Western-African stall. The vegetarian dishes are 63 yuan, and the lamb is 70 yuan. The taste is great. They are happy to eat! We couldn’t find a place to sit and eat, which is very inconvenient and a bit disappoint others. We had to walk through the hall and sit on the concrete floor outside to eat. It was so different from what we imagined, but we had no choice! It would be better if we had tables and chairs to sit and eat. The guests came early to occupy the seats, listen to the music all night, and buy some small drinks and snacks from the hawkers. The time passed. There are three different music stages, each with a different style. I can't wait to experience it again! 4 Thanks BrawBlether",Neutral,Positive

First of all, get there early. It's best to go on Saturday and have a cup of coffee (coffee in many places is outstanding. My favorites are the coffee shop on Elizabeth Street and the Red Globe coffee shop in Deli Shed). I like to eat spinach and Borek cheese for breakfast at Turkish Ladies' Restaurant, but if you want to experience the life of the locals, try German sausages. Well, you have to eat something for the morning. At Deli Shed, I often buy a lot of things. If you want to buy black petrel, there are also there. There are several kinds of Parmesan cheese, the types of cheese are goat cheese, sheep cheese, cow cheese, all of which are very knowledgeable, but if you can go to Nicollet, it is better. Then I competed with some small old Italian women on the street corner for fresh toast. Well, I didn't grab it. I was just a little anxious. I used to be polite, but I can't get bread, so now I will work harder. The best bread is made of Swiss soybeans and flax. My husband hates bread, but he always doesn't eat this kind of bread. Buy some chicken wings at the chicken shop (I have some American friends, I always invite them to Thanksgiving and eat turkey here, she and they always say that the poultry food I make is particularly delicious.) Then go around and see if you can Do you see some cheap things on the market-70 yuan and 3 cheeses. Golden cheese, Watson flower cheese, King Island Camembert are also very delicious.

After ten o'clock, the place became crowded. The market is under the jurisdiction of the City of Melbourne. Everyone always tells you to take good care of your wallet and valuables. I haven't encountered anything. Only those who lose everything and show off their money without scruples will lose things! Go straight to the boutique, right across from McDonald's. Order a cup of coffee there, the taste of desserts is also good, drink coffee and eat desserts leisurely like a local. You even have the opportunity to eat in the open air and enjoy more leisure and coziness. Green tables and chairs are placed along the street, which is very comfortable. In most shops, if you don’t spend much, you only accept cash, so you can’t just bring a charge card or cash card. Wandered in the deli and bought some biscuits. The chicken liver and biscuits at Rose Hut are really rare and delicious. The ham and cheese of various flavors are also perfect match, imported or local, and the taste is amazing. Be sure to visit the meat hall, there is fish. Before going to the clothing and shoes area, of course, you should also go to the fruit and vegetable area. A variety of fruits and vegetables are sold by vendors in the open-air market, which is very interesting. Don't miss the Queen Victoria Market, which is unique in Australia for its spectacular scale and rich variety. It's really great, not a new tourist trap for business. If you can buy something there, of course it would be better to contribute to the development and prosperity of the market! 7 Thanks Victorianlad",Positive,Positive
