It is not recommended to come by car. Even if there is a place to park, it will be blocked for a long time. It is not that far to walk to the city. Public transportation is more convenient.

I have never liked Australian rugby. I feel that the 2006 Commonwealth Games will be ruined by all Australian rugby teams. This game is international, which gives visitors a feeling of viewing.

We went on a special weekend, and parking is not allowed on site unless you have a disabled certificate. Leaving the stadium is a bigger problem.

Nearly 100,000 people gather here, but it is easy to enter the venue, buy drinks and food, and go to the bathroom. We sat in the middle position, impressed by the momentum of the supporters on both sides. Remember to take care of your children, be polite, and enjoy the game.

At that time, I watched the Grand Final with the spectators, only standing in an old stand. When a goal is scored, the smell, the sound, is almost an incredible experience, because the noise and vibration are just deafening. Recently, my son and I went on a trip to explore the interior of this great arena and we were not disappointed. Fascinating stories and history can be seen everywhere, blending with modern buildings and facilities. The most interesting aspect of our journey is the size of the playing field. It looks huge on TV. But in my personal opinion, this huge and empty stand seems a bit smaller than on TV. We spent hours exploring, listening, and feeling. Coming here is a must for tourists and locals alike. Thank gklemm",Positive,Positive

So even if you don’t like this sport, it’s worth a visit because this sports-crazy city dominates the park area, where you can find Melbourne Park Tennis Courts (Rod Laver, Margaret Stadium and Stadium No. 2 dominates) the 1956 Olympic swimming venue and the new football stadium where Collingwood trained.

Cricket appeared after Christmas, after the famous boxing day. He was the only focus in other events throughout the summer. But for most Australia, Australian football at the Melbourne Cricket Ground is spiritual home. In 2016, the AFL Finals will be held on the first day of October. Traditionally, the AFL Finals is on the last Saturday of September. It is always full. I have seen many foreign tourists watching games at MCG, they also like football; you don't need to know these rules, mainly enjoy this wonderful game. You can usually buy tickets for the home team to play the away team. Thank 619jeffry",Neutral,Positive

If you are a cricket fan, there is no better place than the Melbourne Cricket Ground. This is a spectacular stadium, and a guided tour is the best way to explore the stadium and its history.

My father and I are full fans. When he came last year, I took him to visit the ‘G’ stadium. It is beyond our imagination. The tour guide of the Melbourne Cricket Ground is very good.

This is the only problem that makes the tour guide difficult. I recommend it to everyone who has thought about the Australian national football.
